```

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Init your environment - First run only

Employees Lookup (emploo) is based on the Google Programmable Search Engine
(GPSE). More info about GPSE are available here:
https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/tutorial/creatingcse

Firstly, you must create a new empty GPSE by using the
[control panel] (https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all).

Once the new GPSE is create you should run the command `$ emploo init` and,
by using the GPSE control panel, then, you should import the output of this
previous command as an annotation of your fresly created GPSE.

Now copy the GPSE ID corresponding to your fresly created GPSE. It will be
passed to the emploo commands later.

At this point you should visit https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview
and click on the "Get a Key" button to obtain your google API key. It will be
passed to the emploo commands later.

Store your credentials to reuse them later during your researches.

## üöÄ Usage

Simply run the following command and obtain your results at the json format:

```
$ emploo search <company name> -i <google-gpse-id> -k <google-api-key> -o /tmp/example
```

The previous command search for the given company name by using the given
credentials, and output its results into the `/tmp/example` file.

Replace `<company name>` by the name of the company that you want to lookup.
Replace `<google-gpse-id>` and `<google-api-key>` by your own credentials.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Warnings

Google API usages are limited to 100 results max. Even if you own a premium
Google account this threshold still apply. In other words, for now, you can't
collect more than 100 profiles with this tools, but 100 profiles is still a
good starting point to ignit your investigations.

Also you should notice that the Google GPSE queries are limited to a quotas
allowed by days. You are not able to proceed researches against an infinite
number of companies each days. You should perform your researches on a daily
basis.
